\section{Practical Interpretation of our   Results} \label{PracInt}

To  provide some practical interpretation of our  results, we  may  consider the
following hypothetical  scenario. A   control  engineer   has
 designed  a  particular    periodic discrete or sampled-data  controller $K$  for
his closed loop  feedback system.  The engineer finds  out  about  our results and is
interested to hear  that  a  time  invariant controller   can  in  general
give strictly better disturbance rejection  performance than  his  periodic
controller. The engineer then asks  us  to tell  him how to modify  his  periodic
controller to obtain  a  superior   time  invariant controller. To  advise  him   we
