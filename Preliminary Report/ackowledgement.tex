\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This Capstone Project and its supplementary achievements could only have been accomplished through the support of a number of individuals, to whom we would like to extend our thanks. \\

It is our desire to express our heartfelt thanks and gratitude to our supervisor Dr. Palaniswami for his unparalleled guidance and direction in our project. He has been the most influential person in motivating us to do beyond what we thought we could. \\

We would like to extend our sincere appreciation to Dr. Colin Iatrou and Dr. Terrence Caelli, without whom this project would not be possible. They have provided unprecendented insight into the field of medical anaesthesia and wireless systems, which has laid the foundation for our pursuit. \\

We would also like to thank Rajesh Ranjan, who has been ever willing to assist us when we were in need, both academically and practically. \\

Lastly we would like to thank our friends and family, the unsung heroes and heroines who believed in and supported us unconditionally in every possible way. \\
